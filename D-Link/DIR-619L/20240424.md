# DIR-619L Buffer Overflow

D-Link DIR-619L B1 2.06 was found to contain stack overflows in multiple functions in /bin/boa, This vulnerability allows attackers to trigger a denial of service (DoS) through web page parameters. The boa binary is responsible for serving http connection received by the device.

## 1. formWPS Function

### **Vulnerability description**

The websGetVar function obtains the "webpage" parameter from the front-end, whitch is first assigned to the global variable by the strcpy function (as shown at line 23-24 of Figure 1), and then this global variable is finally passed to the sprintf function as an argument (as shown in Figure 2-4). However, due to the lack of data length restrictions, a buffer overflow vulnerability is created.

### **poc**
Authenticated attackers can send a long "webpage" parameter via a post request, which can cause a buffer overflow.

## 2. formWlanSetup_Wizard Function

### **Vulnerability description**

The websGetVar function obtains the "webpage" parameter from the front-end, whitch is first assigned to the global variable by the strcpy function (as shown at line 32-34 of Figure 1), and then this global variable is assigned to the v16 by the strcpy function (as shown at line 46 of Figure 1). However, due to the lack of data length restrictions, a buffer overflow vulnerability is created.

## 3. formWlanGuestSetup Function

The websGetVar function obtains the "webpage" parameter from the front-end, whitch is first assigned to the global variable by the strcpy function (as shown at line 89-92 of Figure 1), and then this global variable is passed into websRedirect function (as shown at line 490-492 of Figure 2), and finally it is passed to the sprintf function as an argument (same as the first vulnerability). 

However, due to the lack of data length restrictions, a buffer overflow vulnerability is created.

## 4. formTcpipSetup

The websGetVar function obtains the "curTime" parameter from the front-end (as shown at line 61 of Figure 1), and stores the data on the stack through the sprintf function (as shown at line 86-88 of Figure 1). However, due to the lack of data length restrictions, a buffer overflow vulnerability is created.
